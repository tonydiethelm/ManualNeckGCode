( This is to cut fret slots on an X" scale length neck. Currently set to 19")
( to calculate fret positions. )

( set depth of cut in mm from "0" being the top of the neck.)
#20 = -1.0

(set scale length here. 24.25" is 615.95mm. 19" = 482.6mm)

(Set number to divide by to find fret positions. We are using the rule of 17.817, per Stew Mac. )
(This might not be right. We don't move the saddle to compensate for string bend. Perhaps this needs to be adjusted.)
#22 = 17.817
