(Manual cut of standard Chickiboom neck. Written by Tony Diethelm. Revisions managed with Git.)


(assume 1/4" bit. 6.35mm diameter. 6.2mm actually. Oh hell, use 6.2mm.)

(set everything up.)
G17	(XY plane)
G21  	(metric)
G90	(absolute programming)

F1000	(feed rate 1000mm/min)
S1	(spindle speed 1rev/min. We don't use spindle speeds, but needed for router to turn on.)
